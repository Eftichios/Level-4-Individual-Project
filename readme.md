A distributed game using adverts in Web Browsers.

This is my Level 4 individual project. It involves tracking the adverts delivered to the web browser of a number of players, 
and creating a game in which players compete to be advertised with some product or category of product.
This means that players will be given a fresh web browser account and some product or category of product (players could possibly
select the product themselves), then the players would browse the web with the purpose of seeing that product as an advert.
The first player to get an advert of that product wins.

This game should allow communication between players and also have data on challenges, achievements and leaderboards.
The technologies that will be used are yet to be decided as it requires quite a bit of research to determine the best strategies.

This is the initial description of the project.
